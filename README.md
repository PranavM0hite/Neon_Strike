Sure, here are the steps to run the provided Node.js code:
1. Install Node.js and npm:

    If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.
    npm (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js, so you don't need to install it separately.

2. Create a project directory:

    Create a new directory for your project.
    Navigate to this directory using the terminal or command prompt.

3. Initialize a new npm project:

    Run npm init -y in the terminal within your project directory to initialize a new npm project. This creates a package.json file with default values.

4. Install necessary dependencies:

    You need to install Express and Socket.IO, as specified in the code.
    Run npm install express socket.io in the terminal to install these dependencies.

5. Run the server:

    In the terminal, navigate to your project directory.
    Run the command node server.js to start the server.
    You should see the message "Example app listening on port 3000" indicating that the server is running.

6. Access the game:

    Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000 to access the game.
    You can open this URL in multiple browser tabs or different browsers to simulate multiple players connecting to the game.
